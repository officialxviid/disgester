DataTables Plugins
==================

This repository contains a collection of plug-ins for the jQuery [DataTables](http://datatables.net) table enhancer. These plug-ins are feature enhancing for the DataTables library, adding extra options to core functionality such as additional sort algorithms, API methods and pagination controls. The plug-ins should not be confused with DataTables "extensions" which are more significant software libraries which add additional features to DataTables.

This repository holds the following plug-in types for DataTables (among others):

* Sorting
  * Type based
  * Custom data source based
* API 
* Filtering
  * Type based
  * Row based
* Internationalisation translations
* Type detection
* Pagination

Please refer to the DataTables [plug-in documentation](http://datatables.net/plug-ins) for details on how to use these plug-ins.


## Internationalisation

In the case of i18n Plugins, we ask that you don't create a pull request and instead make use of the [management system](https://datatables.net/plug-ins/i18n/) that we have in place for this on our website. Changes there will be synced up to this repo.
